The following directions are designed using Wampserver64 and phpmyadmin software after it is installed using default settings, and running on your computer. 

To begin, download and unzip the Group C Project folder

The first step is to set up the database and new user account
#1. Open the browser you selected in your Wampserver setup and type http://localhost/
#2. Select phpmyadmin under the 'Your Aliases' section on the localhost page
#3. After phpmyadmin opens, select the 'User Accounts' tab
#4. Create a new user with the User name 'username,' and password set to 'password.' 'Local' should be selected under Host name.
#5. Next to 'Global privileges' select 'Check all'
#6. Select 'Go' to add the user   
#7. To create a new database, select 'New' from the far left column
#8. On the Database tab, under Create Database, fill in the name field with "telmon_database", select utf8_general_ci, and then select 'create'
#9. The new database should now appear in the left column and already be selected
#10. Go to the Import tab on the top of the page
#11. Browse to the location of the telmon_database.sql file in the unzipped Group C Project folder
#12. Leave all other settings as default and select Go
#13. The databse is now set up for use and you can now close the browser window

The second step is to set up the interface
#1. Open the Wamp64 folder in the C drive
#2. Open the folder labeled 'www'
#3. Copy the css, php, and images folders from the unzipped Group C Project folder and paste them inside 'www'
#4. Open the browser you selected in your Wampserver setup
#5. Type http://localhost/php/department.php in the address bar of your browser
#6. From here, you can navigate through the database and perform various functions on the database like add, delete, and search
